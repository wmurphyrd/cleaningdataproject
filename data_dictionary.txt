Processed accelerometer data from UCI MAchine Learning Respository

The data comes from experiments described by the source as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person 
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration 
and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width 
sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and
body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational
force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each
window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using
a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the
acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using 
another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This data has been processed by cross-referecing separate tables provided in the source to create a comprehensive table and
recombining the training and testing data sets. Of all the available signal summaries, only the mean and standard devations
were retained. 

In the case of tidyAccelerometerDataAggregate.txt, the data is further summarized as the average of each signal type for each
subject-activity pair. 

Each observation has a subject id ("subject") and descriptive activity name ("activity", values match the source descriptions
above). 

The 66 signal variables are listed below, and their names are composites whose meanings are described here

time / frequency : Whether the data is time-domain processed or frequency-domain processed (FFT in source descrpition)
Body / Gravity : The approximate portion of the raw signals that can be asribed to gravity was separated out as described in 
the source description. The Body signals contain the remainder
Accelerometer / Gyroscope : which instrument the signal originated from
Jerk : Derived vales (method in source description) to identify sudden motions
X / Y / X : Signals from an indiviual axis of motation/rotation
MagnituteEuclidean : Composite signal of all three axes (method in source description)
Mean : Average value
StdDev : Standard deviation value
BodyBody : It is not known what this means, and no explanation was found int the source
